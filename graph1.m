%This plots the graph of y = sin(x)
x = -pi:0.2:pi
%the values of x are in increments of 0.2
y = sin(x)
%the plot function is used to plot the graph
plot(x,y)
%xlabel and ylabel functions are used to label the x and y axis
xlabel('x = -pi\0.2\-pi')
ylabel('sin(x)') 
%the title function is used to display the title of the graph
title('Graph of y = sin(x)')
